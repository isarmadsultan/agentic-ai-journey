BACK PROPAGATION IN NEURAL NETWORKS

Lecture Overview:
-----------------

* Topic: Back Propagation in Neural Networks
* Objectives:
  + Understand the concept of back propagation in neural networks

  + Apply back propagation to a simple example using Python

Lecture Outline:
-----------------

I. Introduction (5 minutes)
  - Definition of back propagation and its importance in neural networks
  - Brief history and evolution of back propagation
  - Expected outcomes: students should be able to explain the concept of back propagation

II. Back Propagation Algorithm (15 minutes)
  - Forward pass explanation:
    - Define input, output, and hidden layer activations
    - Explain weight updates using the sigmoid or ReLU activation functions
  - Backward pass explanation:
    - Calculate errors between predicted outputs and actual outputs
    - Compute gradients of cost function with respect to model parameters
  - Example: Back Propagation in a Simple Neural Network

III. Training a Neural Network Using Back Propagation (20 minutes)
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) vs Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)
  - Adam and RMSProp optimization algorithms
  - Regularization techniques for preventing overfitting
  - Example: Training a Neural Network using Keras or PyTorch

IV. Applications of Back Propagation (10 minutes)
  - Image classification and object detection
  - Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis
  - Time series prediction and regression
  - Future research directions in back propagation

Transition Note:
-----------------

* The next section will explore the practical implementation of back propagation using Python.

V. Practical Implementation of Back Propagation (10 minutes)
  - Example code using PyTorch or Keras for a simple neural network
  - Explanation of how to train and test the model
  - Discussion on hyperparameter tuning and experimentation

Conclusion/Q&A (5 minutes)
-------------------------

* Recap the key concepts learned in the lecture
* Leave time for student questions and answers
* Encourage further exploration and research on back propagation.
